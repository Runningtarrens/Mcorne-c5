# Preface

This case is part of the [Mcorne family]( https://github.com/Runningtarrens/Mcorne-overview "Mcorne overview") Its second release of the family and designed for a wireless setup with tha ability to store the battery in the bottom part of the case. This case is made for the new experimental ultralight PCBs from [Pete johanson.](https://github.com/petejohanson/crkbd/tree/board/corne-ultralight "Corne Ultralight") So its not usable as a wired setup, because the cutout is super small, Just to allow the powerswitch to be placed and operated. The print time is pretty short for the parts, also the parts are compact so should be printable on most printers.
