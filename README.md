# Preface

This case is part of the [Mcorne family]( https://github.com/Runningtarrens/Mcorne-overview "Mcorne overview") Its second release of the family and designed for a wireless setup with the ability to store the battery in the bottom part of the case. This case is made for the new experimental ultralight PCBs from [Pete johanson.](https://github.com/petejohanson/crkbd/tree/board/corne-ultralight "Corne Ultralight") So its not usable as a wired setup, because the cutout where the TRRS normally sits is to small, just to allow the powerswitch to be placed and operated. The print time is pretty short for the parts, also the parts are compact so should be printable on most printers.

# Bill of Materials

To print this case youll need:
* about 86 gramms of Filament
* 20 Neodymium Magnets (10mm x 2mm x 2mm)
*  (Optional) 6 Neodymium Magnets round (10mm x 1mm)
*  (Optional) 4 Noedymium Magnets (10mm x 2mm x 2mm)

The optional magnets are only needed if you want to have the tenting setup of the case.


# How to print
 
 I always print the case with PLA, but you can use any filament for the case. ABS/ASA and Filament that require an enclosure are difficult to work with, because if you want to put the magnets in, you have to open the enclosure and might be having problems with warping or cracked prints because of that.
